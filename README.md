## About This Project
This repository contains the Best Searching Algorithm in Open Stock Price Prediction Based on Covid-19 Case Rate using Telkomsel, Indosat and Smartfren stock datasets taken from https://finance.yahoo.com/ with the last 8 years period in .csv format

In finding the best algorithm, samples from the algorithm used are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost, Bagging Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Stacking Classifier, Dummy Classifier and SGDClassifier.

## Result of This Project
The entry of Covid-19 into Indonesia had made investors panic and sells its shares at a low price, resulting in the stock price decreased, although it had increased, but after being analyzed and predicted using 10 data mining classification methods, the best method data mining with the highest accuracy is DummyClassifier with 71% accuracy for Telkom dataset, 71% for Indosat dataset, and 76% for Smartfreen dataset, and it can be concluded that for open stock price prediction for the 3 datasets, it tends to decrease.
